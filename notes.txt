-Raster Order = left-right, top-bottom
-RGB is just electrical signals
-Draw sprites when needed based on X, Y counter
-640*480*24, how much RAM needed?
-RAM needs to be twice as fast as pixel clock to do full frame animation
-Video DAC, and Drawing Engine
-Blitter (Drawing Engine) needs to be aware of the screen and ROM layout
-Draw over same region multiple times to implicitly initiate draw order

-DOUBLE BUFFERING ensures that screen can be drawn as it spans two blanking intervals

640*480*(4 bits per pixel to store rgb values with one unused) = 1228800 bits needed in SRAM (153600 bytes. For double it will be 307200 bytes. Maximum memory is 486000 bytes). Assuming 32 bit data width (one word each), we need 38400 words to store a complete buffer for the video image, with each 640 pixel line requiring 80 words.

Also RAM needs to be twice as fast as pixel clock to do full frame animation.

PNG2HEX converts to B G R, not R G B
